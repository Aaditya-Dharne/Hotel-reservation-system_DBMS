# Storyline

Hotel reservation is an ever-growing business, and it is
fundamental in todayâ€™s life. It automates the booking process for
the customers, and errors are reduced. It also saves time
and cuts costs, and all these points significantly increase 
the customer's satisfaction.

Basically, a hotel needs to maintain the record of guests and
reserve rooms beforehand. Customers should be able to know
the availability of the rooms on a particular date. They should be
able to reserve the available rooms according to their need in
advance. To make their stay comfortable, they should be
provided with food and other services. The record of the food
taken by each customer and the services availed by the customer
should be kept. These records help in generating bills.

These services are provided to the customer through an hotel
reservation app or website on the front-end. But, there are a lot of processes
going on at the back-end of the app, and one of them is database
management. It helps to build the structure of the application.

In this report, we have created a simple database structure,
taking a textbook example of a hotel room reservation system to
see how it works in brief.
